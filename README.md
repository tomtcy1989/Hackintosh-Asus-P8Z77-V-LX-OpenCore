# Hackintosh-Asus-P8Z77-V-LX-OpenCore
### OpenCore 0.6.4 (Build date 3 Nov 2020) on Asus P8Z77-V LX with i5-3570k and RX570

#### This PC runs latest Catalina using this EFI smoothly. 
#### Everything works - DRM, Handsoff, AirDrop, iMessages, FaceTime, SideCar and USB ports are mapped.

# Notes

- If you have the same motherboard, all you need to do is to use ProperTree and add your own SMBIOS (I use iMac17,1 for minimum SideCar support) in Config.plist. You might need to remap the USB ports as we might have different case for the front USB ports.
